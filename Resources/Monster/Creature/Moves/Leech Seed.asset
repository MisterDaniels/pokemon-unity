  description: "Leech Seed plants a seed on the target that drains 1\u20448 of its
    maximum HP at the end of each turn and restores it to the user, or any Pok\xE9mon
    that takes its place. It does not work on Grass-type Pok\xE9mon; it does technically
    work against Pok\xE9mon with the Magic Guard ability, but no HP will be sapped."
